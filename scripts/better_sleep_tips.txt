HOOK: Your bedroom is sabotaging your sleep! These 3 simple changes will have you sleeping like a baby.

BODY: First, temperature matters more than you think. Keep your room between 65-68Â°F. Your body temperature drops to signal sleep time.

Second, banish blue light 1 hour before bed. That means phones, tablets, and TV. Blue light suppresses melatonin production.

Third, create a wind-down ritual. Maybe it's reading, stretching, or journaling. Consistency signals to your brain it's time to sleep.

Bonus tip: Invest in blackout curtains or an eye mask. Even small amounts of light can disrupt your sleep cycles.
