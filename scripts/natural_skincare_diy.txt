HOOK: Want glowing skin without expensive products? These 4 kitchen ingredients will transform your complexion!

BODY: Ingredient #1: Honey - nature's humectant! Apply raw honey as a face mask for 15 minutes. It draws moisture into your skin and has antibacterial properties.

Ingredient #2: Oatmeal - the gentle exfoliator. Blend oats into powder, mix with water, and gently scrub. Perfect for sensitive skin!

Ingredient #3: Green tea - antioxidant powerhouse! Steep tea, let it cool, and use as a toner. The antioxidants fight free radicals and reduce inflammation.

Ingredient #4: Turmeric - the glow booster! Mix a pinch with yogurt for a brightening mask. But warning - it can stain, so patch test first!

Always patch test any new ingredient and remember, consistency is key!
