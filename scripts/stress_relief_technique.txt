HOOK: Feeling overwhelmed by work? This 10-minute stress-busting technique actually works!

BODY: It's called the 5-4-3-2-1 grounding technique. When stress hits, here's what you do:

Name 5 things you can see around you. Really look at them - colors, textures, details.

Name 4 things you can touch. Feel the texture of your shirt, the temperature of your coffee cup.

Name 3 things you can hear. Maybe it's traffic, music, or your own breathing.

Name 2 things you can smell. Coffee, perfume, fresh air - whatever's around you.

Name 1 thing you can taste. Even if it's just the lingering taste of gum or water.

This brings you back to the present moment and activates your parasympathetic nervous system.
