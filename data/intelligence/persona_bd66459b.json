I've been in the fitness industry for 8 years, helping people who don't have time for the gym.\n            \n            My approach is all about efficiency - maximum results in minimum time. I believe you can get incredibly fit with just 20-30 minutes of focused training at home, without any fancy equipment.\n            \n            What sets me apart is my focus on progressive overload principles applied to bodyweight and minimal equipment training. I teach people how to make simple exercises incredibly challenging.\n            \n            My audience is busy professionals, parents, and anyone who wants to get fit but doesn't have hours to spend at the gym.\n            ",
