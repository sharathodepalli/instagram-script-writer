  "story": "\n    Hi, I'm Alex! I'm a marketing professional turned content creator. \n    I've been working in digital marketing for 8 years and recently started sharing \n    my knowledge about social media growth, content strategy, and personal branding.\n    \n    My journey started when I helped my previous company grow from 1K to 100K followers \n    in just 6 months. Now I teach busy entrepreneurs and small business owners how to \n    create content that actually converts.\n    \n    What makes me different is that I focus on practical, no-BS strategies that work \n    even if you only have 30 minutes a day. I've been there - working 60-hour weeks \n    and trying to build a personal brand on the side. I know what actually works \n    when you're short on time but big on ambition.\n    ",
