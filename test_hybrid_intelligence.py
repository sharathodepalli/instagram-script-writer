            Hi, I'm Sarah, a licensed esthetician with 7 years of experience. I specialize in helping people with sensitive skin find gentle, effective routines. 
            
            My journey started when I struggled with my own sensitive skin in my twenties - I tried everything and made every mistake in the book. Now I help others avoid those same painful (and expensive) mistakes.
            
            What makes me different is my focus on skin barrier health and minimal, gentle approaches. I believe less is more when it comes to skincare, especially for sensitive skin types.
            
            My audience is primarily people in their 20s-40s who have sensitive, reactive skin and are tired of products that promise the world but just irritate their skin more.

            My approach is all about efficiency - maximum results in minimum time. I believe you can get incredibly fit with just 20-30 minutes of focused training at home, without any fancy equipment.
